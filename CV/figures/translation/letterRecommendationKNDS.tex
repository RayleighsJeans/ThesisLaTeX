            Mr. Phillip Scholl, born on 15.06.1994 in Demmin, joined the company on 01.07.2021 as a software developer in the field of systems engineering software architecture and components in our company at the Munich location.\\%

            KNDS (KMW+NEXTER Defense Systems) emerged from the merger of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Nexter, two of Europe's leading manufacturers of military land systems based systems in Germany and France. The formation of KNDS marks the beginning of the consolidation of the military land systems industry in Europe. Our product portfolio ranges from from tracked and wheeled vehicles to tank layers and customer service to training and simulation Innovativeness and tradition are not a contradiction to us – “Future needs heritage” is one of KNDS Deutschland guiding principles. At the same time, we continue to think, feel and act as a family-owned company.\\%

            Mr. Scholl's main tasks as a software developer in the department Software Architecture and Components essentially include the following activities:\\%

            \begin{enumerate}[label=$\cdot$,rightmargin=.27\textwidth]
                \item{Software development in C++ by Computer Generated Forces (CGF) for military training simulation}%
                \item{Development and design of a driving behaviour for computer-controlled wheeled and tracked  vehicles}%
                \item{Development and design of a flight behaviour for the categories: Rotary and Fixed Wings}%
                \item{Creation of behaviour trees for CGFs in military training scenarios}%
                \item{Software development of simulator components of the Leopard 2 loading platform}%
                \item{Adoption of test and documentation tasks as part of the development}%
                \item[]{}%
            \end{enumerate}%

            Mr. Scholl showed a high level of initiative and identified fully with his tasks and the company, whereby he also convinced with his great enthusiasm.\\%

            His ability to grasp things very quickly enabled Mr. Scholl to approach difficult issues immediately and to recognize the essential details.\\%

            Mr. Scholl has extremely profound specialist knowledge, which he always used effectively and successfully in practice. He was also able to pass this on to his colleagues without problems.\\%

            He always continued his professional education on his own initiative by attending internal and external seminars and was always very successful in doing so. Mr. Scholl always worked prudently, very conscientiously and precisely. His approach was very well-thought-out and practical.\\%

            The quality of his work, even with difficult tasks and under deadline pressure clearly exceeded our requirements. Mr. Scholl's performance was always highly appreciated in every aspect.\\%

            Mr. Scholl's conduct was always exemplary and he was highly regarded by superiors, colleagues and business partners. Mr. Scholl actively promoted cooperation, was always helpful and put personal interests aside whenever necessary.\\%

            Mr. Scholl is leaving our company on 31.03.2024 at his own request. We very much regret his decision, as we are losing a valuable employee with him. We would like to thank him for his excellent work at all times and wish him all the best for his professional and personal future and continued success.\\[.7cm]%
