""" Notes on thesis images """

- need an extra machine chapter/section that introduces W7X
- core bolometry ->> bolometry

- single line of sight cone through fluxsurface in 2D/3D (if reference?)
- anotate images more (try full picture without caption)
- ask F.Effenberg for permission of image, also journal
- move data specific explanations to appendix and only reference bottleneck
- lz radiation curve from post et al.
- what does the greek translation actually do/mean?


*/ -------------------------------------------------------------------------- /*
- chapter 1
    - set stage for what is important in (fusion) thesis
    - L_z function plot, fract. abund. image better? (Felix)
    - 1985 paper: Post
    - fluxsurfaces from inversion plot
    - tokamak picture (vs. stellarator, yuhei paper?)
    - PhD thesis Felix: power exhaust, why we need radiation
    - show overview plot with dW/dt, P_ECRH, P_rad, ... w. increase/decrease focus
    - introduce two-point model (w. regards two L_z function), Stangeby
    - tomo. inver.: change title, determing local emissivities? why, how
        - complexities, no Abel inv.
    - 3D localisation plot of QSB HBC, VBC and/or QSQ HeBeam

- chapter 2
    - background grey on percentile plot with white channels
    - timing error plot: no dashed, script size, solid colors
    - do plot on temp. impact of cooling water on signal (see archive)
    - power balance:
        - global first
            - show timetraces
            - when it holds, when it doesn't
        - local second:
            - radial power resolved (emissivity core/SOL) +
              inversion or tomogram

- chapter 4
    - reaction time of bolometer: 20180920.049
    - on peak-2-peak relations: note how predictability is strongly dependent
      on state of plasma (params.)
        - need proposal on P, n, f_rad, ...
        - single examples show different results than whole database etc.
        - ne vs. frad for 20180920.049 no hysteresis etc.
        - strong correlation btw. ne_int vs P_rad, but why?
          (20181016.023, 20181016.009, 20181016.036)
    - chamber model: what do I learn from param. variation? recyling time?
    - pressure/flow rate for 20180920.046, ... vs P_rad:
      phase shift, change rate variation over time? with ne?

- chapter 5
