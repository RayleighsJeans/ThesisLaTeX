\end{center}

\section{Introduction}

The Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) is a fusion plasma device designed and operated by the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in Greifswald, Germany \cite{w7x-website}. It is a stellarator-type device, which uses magnetic fields to confine and heat plasma to temperatures of several million degrees Celsius \cite{stix}. The W7-X has been constructed to investigate the suitability of the stellarator concept for use in a future fusion power plant \cite{w7x-website}.

One of the challenges in designing a fusion power plant is the issue of impurity radiation, which can cause the plasma to cool and lose energy. Impurities can enter the plasma from a variety of sources, including the plasma-facing components of the device, fueling and diagnostic systems, and the surrounding atmosphere \cite{hutchinson}. The behavior of impurities in the plasma, including their transport and radiation, is therefore an important area of study in fusion research \cite{militello}. This paper will provide an overview of the W7-X device, with a focus on impurity radiation and transport.

As previously mentioned, one of the main challenges in achieving controlled fusion reactions is the ability to maintain a high-temperature plasma for an extended period of time, while minimizing energy losses due to radiation and other transport mechanisms. One important aspect of this challenge is the management of impurities within the plasma.

Impurities in fusion plasmas can originate from a variety of sources, including the plasma-facing components of the device, residual gases in the vacuum chamber, and the injection of materials for heating or diagnostic purposes. These impurities can lead to radiative energy losses through processes such as line radiation, continuum radiation, and impurity recombination. In addition, impurities can affect the transport properties of the plasma by altering the electron and ion temperatures and densities, as well as the plasma's conductivity and viscosity.

Managing impurities is therefore a critical aspect of designing and operating fusion plasma devices. One such device is the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator, located at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Greifswald, Germany. Wendelstein 7-X is a major experimental device designed to explore the feasibility of using stellarator configurations for magnetic confinement fusion.

The Wendelstein 7-X device features a complex magnetic field configuration, designed to confine a high-temperature plasma using a combination of magnetic field lines that are twisted and turned in three-dimensional space \cite{w7x-magnetic-field}. This three-dimensional magnetic field structure is intended to reduce the impact of turbulent transport on the plasma confinement, and thus enable the plasma to achieve higher densities and temperatures than would be possible in a simpler magnetic confinement device, such as a tokamak.

In addition to its innovative magnetic field configuration, the Wendelstein 7-X device includes a variety of plasma heating and diagnostic systems \cite{w7x-heating-systems}. These systems are used to initiate and maintain the plasma, as well as to monitor its properties and behavior. The heating systems include a variety of techniques, such as electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH), ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH), and neutral beam injection (NBI). These techniques allow for precise control over the heating of different plasma species, and can be used to tailor the plasma's properties to achieve specific experimental goals.

Overall, the Wendelstein 7-X device represents a significant step forward in the development of stellarator fusion devices. Its unique magnetic field configuration and advanced plasma heating and diagnostic systems offer new opportunities for exploring the physics of high-temperature plasmas and developing new techniques for achieving controlled fusion reactions.

In terms of impurity management, the Wendelstein 7-X team has focused on developing operational scenarios that minimize impurity production and transport \cite{w7x-operational-scenarios}. These scenarios involve careful control of the plasma parameters, such as temperature, density, and magnetic field strength, in order to minimize the production of impurities and maximize their transport out of the plasma. In addition, the device includes a number of diagnostic systems for monitoring impurity levels and transport, such as spectroscopic measurements of impurity radiation and particle transport measurements using charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CXRS) \cite{hutchinson}.

Despite these efforts, impurity management remains a significant challenge in fusion plasma research. As plasmas become hotter and more dense, impurities become more difficult to control, and can lead to significant energy losses and other complications. Ongoing research in this area is therefore critical for the continued development of fusion energy as a viable source of clean, sustainable power.

In summary, the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator represents a major advance in the field of fusion plasma research, offering a unique magnetic field configuration and advanced plasma heating and diagnostic

\section{Device Overview}

The W7-X device consists of a ring-shaped vacuum vessel, approximately 16 meters in diameter, surrounded by a series of 50 superconducting magnet coils \cite{w7x-website}. These coils are arranged in a complex three-dimensional geometry, designed to produce a magnetic field that can confine plasma for long periods of time. Unlike other types of fusion devices, such as tokamaks, stellarators do not require a toroidal current in the plasma to produce the confining magnetic field \cite{stix}. Instead, the magnetic field is created by the complex arrangement of the external coils, which allows the plasma to be stabilized against instabilities that can cause it to escape from the confinement region \cite{hutchinson}.

The plasma in the W7-X is created by injecting a gas, typically hydrogen or helium, into the vacuum vessel and heating it with a series of microwave and radiofrequency sources \cite{w7x-website}. The plasma is then confined by the magnetic field, which prevents it from coming into contact with the walls of the vessel. The plasma is monitored and controlled using a variety of diagnostic and feedback systems, including magnetic sensors, X-ray cameras, and laser scattering systems \cite{w7x-website}.

One of the unique features of the W7-X device is its ability to produce a quasi-helical magnetic field configuration \cite{w7x-website}. This configuration is designed to reduce the effects of instabilities and turbulence in the plasma, which can cause it to lose energy and escape from the confinement region \cite{militello}. The quasi-helical configuration is produced by the complex arrangement of the external magnet coils, which are designed to produce a magnetic field that varies in both the toroidal and poloidal directions \cite{w7x-website}.

The Wendelstein 7-X stellarator is one of the largest and most advanced fusion devices in the world, with a total weight of approximately 725 tons and a height of 16 meters \cite{w7x-technical-details}. The device is designed to operate with a plasma volume of up to 5 cubic meters, and is capable of producing plasma temperatures of up to 100 million degrees Celsius.

At the heart of the Wendelstein 7-X device is its complex magnetic field configuration, which is designed to confine the plasma in three dimensions. The magnetic field is generated by a series of 50 superconducting coils, which are arranged in a complex, twisted configuration. The coils are cooled to a temperature of approximately -269 degrees Celsius using liquid helium, in order to maintain their superconducting properties.

The magnetic field configuration of Wendelstein 7-X is based on a concept known as the "stellarator" \cite{w7x-stellarator}. In a stellarator, the magnetic field lines are twisted and turned in three dimensions, creating a configuration that is inherently stable against many types of plasma instabilities. This is in contrast to a tokamak, in which the magnetic field lines are generally toroidal (ring-shaped), and require additional measures to maintain stability.

One of the advantages of the stellarator configuration is its ability to avoid disruptions, which are a major challenge in tokamak-based fusion devices \cite{w7x-disruptions}. Disruptions occur when the plasma becomes unstable and rapidly loses its energy, potentially damaging the device and terminating the fusion process. The twisted magnetic field lines of the Wendelstein 7-X device are designed to stabilize the plasma against disruptions, making the device a potentially more reliable and stable platform for fusion research.

In addition to its innovative magnetic field configuration, the Wendelstein 7-X device includes a variety of other advanced features. These include a high-resolution camera system for monitoring the plasma behavior, a complex system for managing the plasma-facing components of the device, and a variety of diagnostic systems for measuring plasma parameters and impurity transport.

The Wendelstein 7-X device has undergone extensive testing and commissioning since its initial operation in 2015. Early results from the device have been promising, with the production of high-temperature plasmas and the demonstration of stable operation for extended periods of time \cite{w7x-initial-results}. Ongoing research at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics and other fusion research centers around the world will continue to explore the capabilities and limitations of the Wendelstein 7-X device and other fusion plasma devices, in the ongoing effort to achieve controlled fusion reactions and develop fusion energy as a viable source of clean, sustainable power.

\section{Impurity Radiation}

In a fusion plasma, impurities can cause radiation that can cool the plasma and cause it to lose energy \cite{hutchinson}. Impurities can include elements such as carbon, oxygen, and neon, which can enter the plasma from a variety of sources \cite{militello}. The behavior of impurities in the plasma, including their transport and radiation, is an important area of research in fusion plasma devices such as the W7-X.

The radiation from impurities in the plasma can be divided into two main types: line radiation and continuum radiation \cite{hutchinson}. Line radiation occurs when the impurities emit light at specific wavelengths, corresponding to the energy levels of the atoms or ions in the plasma \cite{militello}. Continuum radiation, on the other hand, occurs when the impurities emit light across a broad range of wavelengths, due to the presence of high-energy electrons in the plasma \cite{militello}.

The behavior of impurities in the plasma is influenced by a variety of factors, including their charge state, temperature, and density \cite{hutchinson}. In the W7-X, impurities can enter the plasma from a variety of sources, including the plasma-facing components of the device, fueling and diagnostic systems, and the surrounding atmosphere \cite{militello}. Once in the plasma, impurities can be transported by a variety of mechanisms, including convection, diffusion, and turbulent transport \cite{hutchinson}.

The transport of impurities in the plasma is influenced by the complex magnetic field geometry of the W7-X. The quasi-helical configuration of the magnetic field is designed to reduce the effects of turbulence and instabilities in the plasma, which can cause impurities to be transported across the magnetic field lines and out of the confinement region \cite{militello}. However, the transport of impurities in the W7-X is still an area of active research, as the complex magnetic field geometry can also cause impurities to be trapped in specific regions of the plasma \cite{w7x-website}.

To study the behavior of impurities in the W7-X, a variety of diagnostic techniques are used. One commonly used technique is spectroscopy, which involves measuring the radiation emitted by the impurities in the plasma \cite{militello}. By analyzing the spectrum of the radiation, researchers can determine the identity and concentration of the impurities in the plasma, as well as their temperature and density \cite{hutchinson}. Other diagnostic techniques used in the W7-X include magnetic sensors, X-ray cameras, and laser scattering systems \cite{w7x-website}.

Impurities are a major concern in fusion plasma devices such as Wendelstein 7-X, as they can reduce the efficiency of the fusion process and damage the device's plasma-facing components \cite{w7x-impurities}. Impurities can enter the plasma from a variety of sources, including the walls of the device, the heating and diagnostic systems, and the fuel itself.

One of the key challenges in managing impurities in fusion plasmas is understanding the mechanisms by which they are transported within the plasma. Impurities can be transported by a variety of processes, including convection, diffusion, and turbulence, and their behavior can be affected by the complex magnetic fields and plasma instabilities present in the device.

The transport of impurities in the Wendelstein 7-X device is an active area of research, with a variety of diagnostic systems in place to measure impurity concentrations and transport rates \cite{w7x-impurity-transport}. One of the major challenges in understanding impurity transport in the device is the complex 3D magnetic field configuration, which can lead to non-uniform impurity distributions and unusual transport behavior.

Impurity transport in the Wendelstein 7-X device is particularly important for the operation of the plasma-facing components, which are designed to withstand the high temperatures and intense radiation present in the plasma \cite{w7x-plasma-facing-components}. Impurities can deposit on these components, reducing their performance and potentially leading to failure. Understanding and controlling impurity transport is therefore crucial for maintaining the performance and reliability of the device.

Several methods have been proposed for controlling impurities in fusion plasmas, including the use of impurity injection systems, the optimization of plasma-wall interactions, and the development of advanced divertor configurations \cite{w7x-impurity-control}. These methods are being explored in the Wendelstein 7-X device and other fusion research facilities around the world, with the goal of improving the efficiency and reliability of fusion energy production.

Impurity radiation and transport are important factors to consider in the operation of the Wendelstein 7-X device, as they can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the plasma.

Impurities in the plasma can come from a variety of sources, including the materials used in the device itself, as well as from interactions with the plasma-facing components. These impurities can have a significant impact on the behavior of the plasma, as they can absorb and emit radiation, alter the plasma temperature and density, and affect the confinement properties of the magnetic field.

One of the key challenges in managing impurities in fusion plasmas is to minimize their presence in the first place. This is typically achieved through careful material selection and design of the plasma-facing components, as well as through the use of techniques such as plasma cleaning to remove impurities from the surface of the device \cite{w7x-impurity-management}. However, it is also important to understand the behavior of impurities in the plasma once they are present, in order to predict and control their effects on the fusion process.

In the Wendelstein 7-X device, impurity transport is an important area of research, as it can affect the performance and stability of the plasma \cite{w7x-impurity-transport}. Impurities can be transported by a variety of mechanisms, including convection, diffusion, and turbulence, and their behavior can be affected by a range of plasma parameters, such as temperature, density, and magnetic field strength.

One of the key challenges in understanding impurity transport in fusion plasmas is the complex interplay between different transport mechanisms. For example, turbulence in the plasma can affect the diffusion of impurities, while convective transport can be influenced by the density and temperature gradients in the plasma \cite{w7x-impurity-transport-review}. Modeling and simulation tools are often used to explore the behavior of impurities in fusion plasmas and to predict their effects on the plasma performance.

In addition to understanding the transport of impurities in the plasma, it is also important to consider their effects on plasma radiation. Impurities in the plasma can absorb and emit radiation at a variety of wavelengths, which can impact the overall power balance of the plasma and affect the performance of diagnostic systems used to measure plasma parameters \cite{w7x-impurity-radiation}. This can be particularly important in the Wendelstein 7-X device, which relies on sophisticated diagnostic systems to monitor the behavior of the plasma.

Overall, impurity radiation and transport are important areas of research in the operation of the Wendelstein 7-X device, as they can affect the stability, performance, and diagnostic capabilities of the plasma. Ongoing research in these areas will continue to explore the behavior of impurities in fusion plasmas and to develop strategies for minimizing their impact on the fusion process.

One of the challenges in designing a fusion power plant is the issue of impurity radiation, which can cause the plasma to cool and lose energy. The behavior of impurities in the plasma, including their transport and radiation, is therefore an important area of study in fusion research.

The W7-X device uses a complex magnetic field geometry to confine and stabilize the plasma. The quasi-helical configuration of the magnetic field is designed to reduce the effects of instabilities and turbulence in the plasma, which can cause impurities to be transported across the magnetic field lines and out of the confinement region. However, the transport of impurities in the W7-X is still an area of active research, as the complex magnetic field geometry can also cause impurities to be trapped in specific regions of the plasma.

To study the behavior of impurities in the W7-X, a variety of diagnostic techniques are used, including spectroscopy, magnetic sensors, X-ray cameras, and laser scattering systems. These diagnostic techniques provide information about the identity, concentration, temperature, and density of impurities in the plasma, which can be used to better understand their behavior and develop strategies for mitigating impurity radiation in future fusion power plants.
