%%% settings
\SetTracking[no ligatures]{encoding={*}, shape=sc}{40} % adds additional space between small capitals (should always be done) and disables all ligatures for small caps
\frenchspacing % this is a babel option. Double spaces after a period are english tradition, french tradition is single space after a point.
