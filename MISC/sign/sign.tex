Thank you so much for taking care of our cats while we are away.%

Below are is rough guide on how to for care for our little tigers - please don't stress too much about details, they are fed well enough as is anyway. Also, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.%

\bigskip

\mybox{%
{\large\underline{\textbf{
    daily (anytime that suits, ideally in the evening)}}}

{\fontsize{10}{10}\selectfont
\begin{itemize}
    \item feed once
    \item each cat gets wet food with some (tap) water in own bowl
    \item portions are in pouces/cans in the oven (close afterwards so they can't get at it themselves)
    \item Carlo (big, fat tux chub) can have extra water on the food
    \item redo/refill water bowls (in kitchen next to food bowls)
    \item don't worry if not all show up immediately for food - with 'strangers' some are shy at first
\end{itemize}}

\textbf{litter boxes:}
{\fontsize{10}{10}\selectfont
\begin{itemize}
    \item scoop all litter boxes daily into toilet and flush liberally
    \item theres is two in the ground floor and two in the upstairs family bathroom
    \item we will set up everything before we leave, should you feel you need new litter there is some in the hot press
\end{itemize}}
}

\underline{\textbf{general care}}:
{\fontsize{10}{10}\selectfont
\begin{itemize}
    \item we have cameras to check in on them occasionally - should you feel there is something wrong though please let us know
    \item when you first get you can open the kitchen window (sink) so they can get out to their little terrace and close before you leave
    \item if you have time to spare, toys (fishing rods etc.) are in the living room
    \item should you find occasional hairballs etc. pick them up as you see fit, don't feel the need to clean up after them 
    \item cleaning utilities are in the lower bathroom - green spray bottle is bleach, other is enzymatic pet cleaner
\end{itemize}}

\underline{\textbf{in case of emergency or concerns}:}

    \item Stella: \textbf{[+353 87 3445 604, stella0scholl@gmail.com]}
